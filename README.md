### ⚠️ **Note on Deployment Status**
```diff
- Although the deployment pipeline is correctly configured and functional,
- the EC2 instance is intentionally kept off to avoid AWS billing. 
- This causes the CI/CD pipeline to show a "failed" status temporarily, 
- but this does not reflect any issues with the deployment setup.
